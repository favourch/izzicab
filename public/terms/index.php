Thus, we suggest you to subscribe for a data plan with unlimited or very high data usage capacity.
<br>
4.7. Fares. You are entitled to charge a fare for each instance you have accepted a Customer via the Izzicab App and completed the Transportation Service as requested (i.e. Fare). The Fare is calculated based on a default base fare, the distance of the specific travel as determined by the GPS-based device and the duration of the specific travel. In case you are a licensed taxi service provider, you may determine the Fare based on the taximeter, if you are legally obliged to do so. In such case you must adjust the fare proposed in the Izzicab App to match the actual Fare. Please bear in mind that the default base fare is the recommended fare as presented in the Izzicab App. The default base fare may fluctuate based on the local market situation. You may negotiate a Fare that is lower than the default base fare by sending Izzicab a pertinent request. All such requests shall be considered in good faith. Additionally, you shall always have the right to charge the Customer less than the Fare indicated by the Izzicab App or the taximeter (however, please note that charging the Customer less than the Izzicab App indicates does not decrease the Izzicab Fee).
<br>
4.8.

Izzicab may also reduce or cancel the fare in case we have reasonable cause to suggest a fraud or a complaint by the Customer indicates a violation by you.

<br>
4.9. Customer may pay the fare for the Transportation Service either directly to you or via the In-app Payment as described in section 6 of these General Terms. In case the Customer pays the Fare directly, it is your obligation to collect the Fare. In case the Customer fails or refuses to pay, Izzicab will help you with collecting the Fare due, however Izzicab has no obligation to compensate the Fare.
<br>
4.10. Receipts. After each successful provision of Transportation Services, Izzicab shall create a receipt consisting of the route, fare, time and other relevant information of a particular ride.

<br>
4.11. Penalties. In case the Customer cancels the request for Transportation Services after 3 minutes or does not show up, Izzicab shall have the right to request a penalty from such Customer.

If the Customer does not consent to paying the penalty and/or compensating the damage, you must notify the Affiliate or Izzicab (depending on who provides the Izzicab Services in the local region) of the matter at hand. Any such notification must be presented to Izzicab or Affiliate within 24 hours and be accompanied with pictures or other sufficient proof of damages. Izzicab will then try to collect penalty and/or relevant costs on your behalf from the Customer. However, please bear in mind that Izzicab is not taking any liability for direct or indirect damages caused by Customers. Also bear in mind that you are not to engage in any fisticuffs with a Customer due to any damage, which must have been done to your vehicle by a Customer.

You additionally agree that any payments made by the Customers via the In-app Payment shall be considered the same as payments made directly to you.
<br>
6.2. You may not refuse payment by the Customer via the In-app Payment, or influence the Customer against the use of the In-app Payment. In case you refuse to accept an In-app Payment without just cause, Izzicab shall be entitled to charge you a contractual penalty in the amount of ₦4000 for every refusal and/or block your right to use the Izzicab App in case of repetitive behaviour.
<br>
6.3. Izzicab will regularly transfer the amounts collected as In-app Payments, which have been credited to the Izzicab's bank account in the preceding week, to your bank account by the 4th day of the following week, but in no case later than within two weeks. The Izzicab Fee shall be deducted from your Fare. If you request a review of the In-app Payment, then Izzicab may transfer the amounts collected after it has concluded the review.
<br>
6.4. You are entitled to review In-app Payment reports in the Izzicab Driver's Portal. Izzicab will send weekly In-app Payment & Driver's account balance to your e-mail. The reports will show the amounts of the In-app Payments brokered in the previous week as well as the withheld amounts of the Izzicab Fee. The reports will be sent weekly.
<br>
6.5. Please note that Izzicab is not obliged to pay you the Fare due from the Customer if the In-app Payment failed because Customer's credit card or mobile payment is cancelled or is unsuccessful for reasons not attributable to Izzicab. In such case we will help you in requesting the Fare due from the Customer, and shall transmit it to you once the Customer has made the requested payment.
<br>
6.6. Before rendering Transportation Services, you must verify that the service is being actually provided to the Customer or that the Customer has expressly confirmed that it allows the passenger to ride under its account. If you make a mistake in identifying the Customer, and the In-app Payment is charged to a person, who has not been provided or has not approved the Transportation Services, Izzicab shall reimburse the Customer for the Fare. In such case you are not entitled to receive the Fare from Izzicab. Additionally, for every wrongfully applied In-app Payment Izzicab shall be entitled to charge you a contractual penalty up to ₦4000.
<br>
6.7. You hereby warrant that you understand that In-app Payment does not supersede the requirements established by the laws and regulations, e.g. your obligation to provide the Customer with a receipt printed out on the printer.

Such compensation shall be paid you concurrently with payment of the Fares. Izzicab may set off the marketing compensation against the Izzicab Fee.
<br>
9.4. Izzicab may also carry out other campaigns for Drivers and/or the Customers under the terms accompanying the specific campaign.
