          <h1> Izzicab Terms and Conditions for Passengers</h1>
          <br>
Izzicab is a web-based app for ordering transportation; it communicates transportation service requests to the transportation service providers who have been registered as users of the Izzicab system. The private limited Izzicruiz resources(registry code xxxxxx), founded in Anambra state, Nigeria,  is the holder of rights and service provider of the Izzicruise app and the operation of the app in Nigeria is carried out through its affiliate, Izzicruiz resources
<br>
<h3>1. Using the Izzicruise app</h3>
<br>
1.1 The use of the Izzicab app requires installation of the software and registration of a user account. During the installation of the Izzicab app, the mobile number of the Izzicab service user is linked to the respective user account and added to the database.
<br>
1.2 When using the Izzicab app, the user can choose whether he/she wishes to pay in cash or via mobile payment for the transportation service to the driver. Once a payment option has been selected, the user cannot change this.
<br>
1.3 Any complaints can be sent to our support team via email Support@izzicab.com or by calling our support line +2347062366093(available on weekdays 09.00-17.00 W.A.T).
<br><br>
2.1 Mobile payments can be made by a user of the Izzicab app who has included his/her card on the app.
<br>
2.2 When making mobile payments, the receiver of the payment is Izzicruiz resources, who forwards the received payment to the transportation service provider.
<br>
2.3 When making card payments or mobile payments, a service fee is added per each order of transportation service. The named service fee includes payment commission fees, incl. Visa / MasterCard service fees. The amount of the service fee is displayed in the mobile app. 
<br>
2.4 The intermediation of card payments in the Izzicab app is carried out through Paystack and/or PAYU pursuant to the following Terms & Conditions.https://paystack.com/terms and https://www.payu.com.ng/legal .
<br>
2.5 Izzicab shall be responsible for the functioning of card payments and offers card owners support in solving problems. The resolution of card and mobile payment related disputes also takes place through Izzicab in cases where the issue is directly related to the in-app payment process. The contact for Izzicab credit card and mobile payment support service is: contact@izzicab.com and phone number +2347062366093 – Inquiries submitted by e-mail shall receive a response within 72 business hours.

<br>
2.6 When offering card and mobile payments, Izzicab acts as the economic agent of transportation service providers by intermediating payments made in the Izzicab app. The obligation of the customer in front of the transportation service provider shall be considered fulfilled as of the moment when the payment order is made for the payment of funds into the Izzicab bank account. Izzicab  shall not be responsible for the exercise of the customer's payment order.
<br>
<h3>3. Ordering or cancelling a transportation service</h3>
<br>
3.1 If the Izzicab app user orders a vehicle and the driver has confirmed the receipt of service then the transportation is considered pre-ordered.
<br>
3.2 Cancelling the use of an ordered transportation is considered to be the situation where the driver has been notified about the receipt of an order and the Izzicab app user waives the use of the transportation service after a notice has been received.
<br>
3.3 Cancelling the use of an ordered transportation is also considered to be the situation where the user of the Izzicab app or people whom the transportation was ordered for do not appear in the vehicle within 8 minutes as of the time when the driver notified them about the arrival of the vehicle in its destination.
<br>
3.4 In case of cancelling the transportation service the Izzicab app user is required to pay 800 Naira as a penalty fee. In the event that the Izzicab user notifies about the cancelling of transportation service within 5 minutes as of receiving of the notification concerning the receipt of the order through Izzicab, the user does not have to pay the penalty fee.
<br>
3.5 We have the right to revoke the right to use the app if the user has waived the use of transportation service on 3 successive instances in one 24 hour period. In that case the app notifies the user about the number of cancellations and after waiving the 3rd time, Izzicab cancels the usage right. Izzicab usage right can be cancelled for up to six months. After that the user can reactivate his/her user account by contacting the local team via email. Access to app can also be revoked on the basis of harassment, providing false information/allegations and engaging in any criminal activities.

<br>
4.2 The use of the Izzicab app is based on a non-exclusive licence issued by Izzicab OÜ. The licence agreement is valid for a non-limited period and is free of charge for the customer. In case of any faults in the software, we shall endeavour to correct them as soon as possible, but please keep in mind that the functionality of the app may be restricted due to occasional technical errors and we are not able to guarantee unlimited faultless functioning of the app at all times. We shall also accept no liability for any losses incurred as a consequence of the Izzicab app not functioning or not being usable in the desired manner. In the event that the customer's right to use the app is cancelled, the corresponding non-exclusive licence shall also be repealed.
<br>
4.3 As the Izzicab app is primarily a link between customers and transportation service providers, Izzicab cannot influence or take any responsibility for the quality or defects of the service. Driver-partners are not employees and for this reason, we are unable to guarantee consistently accurate and faultless provision of transportation services located via Izzicab. For resolving complaints please contact our support team (referred to in clause 1.3).
<br>
4.4 The Izzicab app does not constitute an offer or brokerage of transportation for customers. The Izzicab app is not a means for organising the provision of transportation services. It is also not an agency service for finding customers for transportation providers.
<br>

<br>
6.4 Izzicab shall make every effort to ensure that only drivers, who have integrity and are respectful of their profession and customers, use the Izzicab app. However, we are in no position to guarantee that every provider of transportation services, located via the Izzicab app, satisfies the aforementioned criteria at all times. If you experience objectionable transportation service, please notify the company responsible for the service, a supervisory authority or our support team (referred to in clause 1.3).
<br>
